# 🚦 Traffic Light Simulation  

This project was developed after accepting a **TikTok challenge** by [**Global Tech Sailors**](https://www.tiktok.com/@gtechsailors/) to create a **traffic light system** that changes colors at specific time intervals and continues this cycle infinitely using **Vanilla JavaScript**. The project demonstrates **real-world traffic light behavior**, accurately demonstrated and inspired by the **Cnr Sanders & Forbes traffic light giving way to Healed Street** at Meadowlands, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa.

## 🌟 Features  
✅ **Standard Traffic Light Cycle** (Red → Yellow → Green)  
✅ Uses **CSS animations** and **JavaScript timing functions**  
✅ **Responsive** design for different screen sizes  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML** for structure  
- **CSS** for styling and animations  
- **JavaScript** for logic and transitions  

## 🚀 Setup  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/TheOptimisticDev/traffic-light-simulation.git

2. Open index.html in a browser.
